# AI Usage Documentation
This files documents how AI tools were used during this project.
## What AI Was Used For
1) Helping clarify coding errors when Python raised exceptions
2) Providing suggestions on how to structure PCA, regression modeling, and plotting
## What AI Was Not Used For
1) No code was executed by AI
2) AI did not generate or modify datasets
3) AI did not perform any analysis
4) Modeling training, evaluation, and all figures were created exclusively by me in Anaconda JupyterLab
## How AI Outputs Were Verified
1) All code suggestions were manually rewritten or tested by me
2) Outputs were compared against expected numerical ranges (MAE, R^2)
3) I verified plots matched the underlying data
4) Any AI-suggested code was corrected if errors occurred
## Reproducibility
Everything in the repository can be fully reproduced by running:
1) Week1_Microbiome.ipynb
2) Week2_Microbiome.ipynb
3) Week3_Microbiome.ipynb
These notebooks contain all data processing and modeling steps required for the project
